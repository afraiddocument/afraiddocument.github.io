Hi! I'm Randall Betts, a Computer Science student at **Samford University**. I’m passionate about programming, exploring new technologies, and building practical software solutions. This site is my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills, academic achievements, and areas of tech that excite me.  

## About Me
I’ve had the chance to explore a wide range of programming languages and technologies:  

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, C++, SQL, HTML  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React Native, Node.js  
- **Databases & Tools:** PostgreSQL, Git, GitHub  
- **IDE:** VS Code  

I’m also gaining exposure to **cybersecurity**, including governance, risk management, and operational security.  

## Academic Highlights
I take pride in my academic record, which includes strong performance across core computer science and cybersecurity courses:  

- **Intro to Computer Science** – A  
- **Intro to Programming I & II** – A  
- **Discrete Structures** – A  
- **Computer Architecture** – A  
- **Advanced Programming Concepts** – A  
- **Databases & Information Management** – A  
- **Principles of Programming Languages** – A  
- **Operating Systems** – A  
- **Cybersecurity GRC** – A  
- **Cybersecurity Operations** – A  

I’m currently enrolled in **Introduction to Cybersecurity and Software Development**, where I’m further building my skills in software design, development, and secure computing practices.  

## Skills in Action
While I’m just starting my project portfolio, I’ve worked extensively in lab exercises and class projects involving:  
- Building small applications and scripts in Python, Java, and JavaScript  
- Creating interactive interfaces with React Native  
- Designing databases and querying with SQL/PostgreSQL  
- Developing simple APIs using Node.js  

I’m looking forward to applying these skills to **real-world projects and collaborations** soon.
